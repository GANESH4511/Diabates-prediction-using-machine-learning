# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based web application** that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not, based on health parameters. The app is built using **Python, Streamlit, and an XGBoost model** trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

## 📂 Project Structure  

- `Diabetes_prediction_using_machine_learning.ipynb` → Jupyter/Colab notebook for training the ML model  
- `diabetes prediction web app.py` → Streamlit web application script  
- `diabetes.csv` → Dataset used for training 
- `trained_model.sav` → Saved trained XGBoost model

## 🚀 Features  

- Simple and interactive **web interface** built with Streamlit  
- Predicts diabetes based on user input (Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, etc.)  
- Model trained using **XGBoost classifier**  
- Easy to run locally or deploy on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS**
